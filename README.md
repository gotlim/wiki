# Gotlim Internal Wiki

This wiki serves as a central location for all of our team members to access important information about our startup and to collaborate on projects.

Here we have information about our teams, products and services, and development processes. We use GitHub as our project management tool, and we have organized our projects into several columns that represent the different stages of work.

## Columns in our GitHub Projects

Our GitHub projects are organized into several columns that represent the different stages of work for our tasks and issues. Each column represents a specific stage in the development process and is designed to help us stay organized and on track as we work on our project.

By using these columns in combination with GitHub's project management tools, we can keep track of the progress of our project and ensure that everyone on the team is working towards the same goals.

Here's a detailed explanation of each of the columns in our project:

### New

This column is where we add new tasks or issues that have been identified but have not yet been prioritized or added to the backlog. The column serves as a holding area for items that need to be evaluated and prioritized before they can be added to the backlog.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the New column include new feature requests, bug reports, or other issues that have been identified by members of our team or by our users.

### Backlog

The Backlog column is where we keep a prioritized list of tasks or issues that need to be addressed in the future. This column serves as a central location for all of the work that needs to be done on our project.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the Backlog column include long-term goals for our project, major features that we want to implement, or a list of tasks that need to be completed in a specific order.

### Ready

The Ready column is where we move tasks or issues that are ready to be worked on by the team. This column serves as a queue for work that is ready to be started.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the Ready column include tasks that have been fully defined and are waiting for someone to start working on them, or tasks that are at the top of our prioritized backlog.

### In progress

The In progress column is where we move tasks or issues that are currently being worked on by someone on the team. This column serves as a way to indicate that a task is actively being worked on and is not available for others to start working on.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the In progress column include tasks that a developer is actively working on, or tasks that are being reviewed by a team member.

### In review

The In review column is where we move tasks or issues that are ready for review by someone else on the team. This column serves as a way to indicate that a task is ready for feedback or review.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the In review column include tasks that a developer has completed their work on and is ready for review, or tasks that are being reviewed by a team member before they are marked as done.

### Done

The Done column is where we move tasks or issues that have been completed and are ready to be closed out. This column serves as a way to indicate that a task has been fully completed and is ready to be marked as done.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the Done column include tasks that a developer has finished working on a feature or fixed a bug, or tasks that have been reviewed and approved by a team member.
