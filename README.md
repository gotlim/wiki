# Gotlim Internal Wiki

This wiki serves as a central location for all of our team members to access important information about our startup and to collaborate on projects.

Here we have information about our teams, products and services, and development processes. We use GitHub as our project management tool, and we have organized our projects into several columns that represent the different stages of work.

## Issues

Issues are used to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to software development. Here is a brief overview of their purpose and some examples of how they are used:

Purpose:

- **Keep track of tasks and bugs**: Issues can be used to keep track of tasks that need to be completed or bugs that need to be fixed in a particular project.
- **Assign tasks**: Issues can be assigned to team members, making it clear who is responsible for completing the task.
- **Prioritize tasks**: Issues can be labeled with priority levels, making it easy to see which tasks are the most urgent or important.
- **Facilitate communication**: Users can comment on issues to provide additional information, ask questions, or provide updates.

Examples:

- **Bug reports**: If a user discovers a bug in a piece of software, they can create an issue to report it. The issue should include a description of the bug, steps to reproduce it, and any other relevant information.
- **Feature requests**: If a user has an idea for a new feature or improvement to existing functionality, they can create an issue to suggest it. The issue should include a description of the feature, why it is needed, and any other relevant information.
- **Tasks**: Issues can also be used to track tasks that need to be completed, such as updating documentation, fixing formatting issues, or writing new code.
- **Discussions**: Issues can be used to start discussions about particular topics related to the project, such as design decisions or future directions.

## Milestones

GitHub milestones help teams organize and track progress towards our project goals. They are a way of grouping related issues together, and they can be used to track progress towards specific objectives or deadlines. Here is a brief overview of their purpose and some examples of how they are used:

Purpose:

- **Organize related issues**: Milestones can be used to group related issues together, making it easier to see which issues are related to which goals or objectives.
- **Track progress**: Milestones can be used to track progress towards specific goals or deadlines. Each milestone has an associated progress bar that shows how many of its related issues have been completed.
- **Set deadlines**: Milestones can have due dates associated with them, which can help teams stay on track and meet their objectives.

Examples:

- **Release cycles**: If a software development team is working on a new release of their product, they might create a milestone for each release cycle. Each milestone would include a set of related issues that need to be completed before the release can be shipped.
- **Sprint goals**: Agile development teams might use milestones to track progress towards specific sprint goals. Each milestone would represent a sprint, and the associated issues would be the tasks that need to be completed during that sprint.
- **Feature sets**: If a team is working on a complex feature that requires multiple issues to be completed, they might create a milestone to track progress towards that feature. The milestone would include all of the related issues, and the progress bar would show how much of the feature has been completed.

## Projects

GitHub projects help teams organize and manage their work. Projects provide a way to visualize and track the progress of work items such as issues and pull requests in a more organized way than simply using a list of issues. Here is an overview of their purpose and some examples of how they are used:

Purpose:

- **Organize work**: Projects can be used to organize work items, such as issues or pull requests, into a more structured format than a simple list.
- **Track progress**: Projects provide a visual representation of the progress of work items, making it easy to see what has been completed and what still needs to be done.
- **Collaborate**: Projects can be shared with team members, making it easy for everyone to stay on the same page and work together more effectively.
- **Prioritize work**: Projects can be organized into columns, allowing you to prioritize work items and ensure that the most important items are completed first.

Examples:

- **Sprint planning**: Projects can be used to organize work items for a particular sprint or development cycle. Items can be added to columns representing different stages of the development process, such as "To do", "In progress", and "Done".
- **Bug triage**: Projects can be used to organize and prioritize bugs that need to be fixed. Items can be added to columns representing different severity levels, such as "Critical", "High", and "Low".
- **Feature development**: Projects can be used to organize and track the development of new features. Items can be added to columns representing different stages of development, such as "Planning", "In progress", and "Testing".
- **Team workflows**: Projects can be used to organize and track the progress of team workflows, such as code reviews or documentation updates. Items can be added to columns representing different stages of the workflow, such as "Requested", "In progress", and "Approved".

### Columns our Projects

Our GitHub projects are organized into several columns that represent the different stages of work for our tasks and issues. Each column represents a specific stage in the development process and is designed to help us stay organized and on track as we work on our project.

By using these columns in combination with GitHub's project management tools, we can keep track of the progress of our project and ensure that everyone on the team is working towards the same goals.

Here's a detailed explanation of each of the columns in our project:

#### New

This column is where we add new tasks or issues that have been identified but have not yet been prioritized or added to the backlog. The column serves as a holding area for items that need to be evaluated and prioritized before they can be added to the backlog.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the New column include new feature requests, bug reports, or other issues that have been identified by members of our team or by our users.

#### Backlog

The Backlog column is where we keep a prioritized list of tasks or issues that need to be addressed in the future. This column serves as a central location for all of the work that needs to be done on our project.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the Backlog column include long-term goals for our project, major features that we want to implement, or a list of tasks that need to be completed in a specific order.

#### Ready

The Ready column is where we move tasks or issues that are ready to be worked on by the team. This column serves as a queue for work that is ready to be started.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the Ready column include tasks that have been fully defined and are waiting for someone to start working on them, or tasks that are at the top of our prioritized backlog.

#### In progress

The In progress column is where we move tasks or issues that are currently being worked on by someone on the team. This column serves as a way to indicate that a task is actively being worked on and is not available for others to start working on.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the In progress column include tasks that a developer is actively working on, or tasks that are being reviewed by a team member.

#### In review

The In review column is where we move tasks or issues that are ready for review by someone else on the team. This column serves as a way to indicate that a task is ready for feedback or review.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the In review column include tasks that a developer has completed their work on and is ready for review, or tasks that are being reviewed by a team member before they are marked as done.

#### Done

The Done column is where we move tasks or issues that have been completed and are ready to be closed out. This column serves as a way to indicate that a task has been fully completed and is ready to be marked as done.

Examples of tasks that might be added to the Done column include tasks that a developer has finished working on a feature or fixed a bug, or tasks that have been reviewed and approved by a team member.
